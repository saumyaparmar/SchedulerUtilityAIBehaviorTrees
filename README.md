# SchedulerUtilityAIBehaviorTrees

This project is built using Unreal Engine in C++, focuses on creating behavior-driven NPCs that simulate realistic daily routines and work shifts in a town environment. Inspired by The Sims needs-based AI and Red Dead Redemption 2  time-based scheduling, the system adjusts NPC behavior based on traits like personality and body type, integrating with Unreal Behavior Tree AI systems and day-night cycle for authenticity.

The architecture is split into two levels of decision-making: High-Level Task Scheduling, which uses Utility AI to determine NPC priorities based on their needs, time of day, and personal traits, and Low-Level Task Execution, which is handled by Behavior Trees in Unreal Engine. This separation ensures both strategic decision-making and detailed task execution.

By combining these systems, the project creates dynamic, responsive NPCs whose actions adapt in real-time, providing a more immersive and lifelike simulation. The modular framework allows for future expansion, enabling more complex behaviors and interactions.
